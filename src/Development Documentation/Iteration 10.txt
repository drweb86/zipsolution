Plan:
[DONE]
1. German language adding

[DONE] 
2. German installation adding
[DONE]
3. Requests for german translator
[FIXED]
- Perhaps you can make the field (ID 9) below a bit larger to fit the German translation.
[FIXED]
- you misspelled "TortoiseSvn". There is "T_urtoise" everywhere in the program + docu :-)
[FIXED by workaround. This issue discovered only in OS Vista]
- The formatting of the "format variables help" is not so nice after translation 
[FIXED]
4. Bug: cONTROL iSrELEASE was enabled when there's no selected solution(!)
